# Part 3. Paired Comparisons
## Sports Analytics with R
### MeDaScIn 2018

# Sport Competition

Whether it's two individuals or two teams, most sport competition comes down to a paired comparison. 

![](dog_surf.gif)

---

# Win Ability

- The 'comparison' of main interest in sport is a competitors ability to win

- How competitors have fared against each other gives us the most direct information about their respective win abilities

- The family of `paired comparison models` are useful tools for estimating that ability 


![](lebron.gif)

---

# Question: Abilities

- Suppose we have two competitors who are going to face each other

- Further suppose we know that Competitor A has ability `\(\delta_A\)` and Competitor B has ability `\(\delta_B\)` 

- What properties of `\(\delta_A\)` and `\(\delta_B\)` would make us favor one competitor over another?

--

Answer: We should favor the competitor with greater ability.

# Bradely-Terry-Luce

.cbox[
### One of the most popular paired comparison models is the Bradley-Terry-Luce model.
]

- Bradley-Terry-Luce encapsulates the idea that competition results tell us about the underlying abilities of the competitors.

- Relative ability is modeled as a logistic function of wins:

&lt;br&gt;

$$
P(Win_A = 1) = \frac{\exp{(\delta_A - \delta_B)}}{1 + \exp{(\delta_A - \delta_B)}}
$$

---

# BTL Properties

- Win expectations all come down to the difference in abilities

- An equal difference, `\(\delta_A - \delta_B\)`, implies the same win expectation no matter the individual abilities of `\(A\)` and `\(B\)`

- Expectations are even when `\(\delta_A -\delta_B = 0\)`

- Roughly +10% for every added difference in ability of 0.4

# BTL in R

- `BradleyTerry2` (authors Turner and Firth) is an R package for fitting BTL models

- It uses maximum-likelihood to estimate competitor abilities

- It can incorporate covariates

- Other binary families can also be fit


```r
install.packages("BradleyTerry2")
```

---

# Function BTm

The main workhorse function for the BTL model is `BTm`. Here is the general syntax:


```r
BTM(outcome, player1, player2, ...)
```

- `outcome` is with respect to `player1`

- `player1` must be a factor with same levels as `player2`

- `player2` must be a factor with same levels as `player1`

Note: The `outcome` is with respect to `player1`.

# English Premier League

We can download the current standings for the EPL from the [www.football-data.co.uk](www.football-data.co.uk)


```r
football &lt;- "http://www.football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/1718/E0.csv"

data &lt;- read.csv(football, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

---

# EPL Data

Each row is a summary of a particular EPL game. The variables of interest are:

- HomeTeam: The name of the home team

- AwayTeam: The name of the away team

- FTHG: Goals scored by home team

- FTAG: Goals scored by away team

---

# Example: Basic BTL

Below we derive an indicator for wins and losses and then fit a BTL using the `BTm` function.


```r
library(BradleyTerry2)

data &lt;- data %&gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(
    outcome = as.numeric(FTHG &gt; FTAG),
    HomeTeam = factor(HomeTeam, levels = unique(c(HomeTeam, AwayTeam))),
    AwayTeam = factor(AwayTeam, levels = levels(HomeTeam))
  )



fit &lt;- BTm(outcome, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, 
           data = data)
```

---

# BTm Methods

The result of `BTm` has all of the standard methods of `glm` models.

- `print` : Model summary and point estimates of coefficients


- `summary`: More detailed summary of estimates (including standard errors)

- `plots`: Residual diagnostic plots

---


# Abilities

A useful function for extracting the abilities on the log scale is with the function `BTabilities`.


```r
abilities &lt;- BTabilities(fit) # Matrix of ability and StdErr

abilities &lt;- data.frame(
  Team = rownames(abilities),
  Ability = abilities[,1],
  SE = abilities[,2]
)

abilities$Team &lt;- factor(abilities$Team, 
                        levels = abilities$Team[order(abilities$Ability)],
                        order = T)
```

# Question

What are some of the shortcomings of our current model?

--

Some possibilities:

- No home/away advantage

- We treat ties as losses for Home team

---

# Home Advantage

It is generally thought that a team gets a boost in their win expectations when playing at home. 

To introduce a home advantage covariate, we need to restructure out dataset and add a covariate for each team factor. 


```r
data$Home &lt;- data.frame(
  Team = data$HomeTeam, 
  at.home = 1
)

data$Away &lt;- data.frame(
  Team = data$AwayTeam, 
  at.home = 0
)
```

---

# Home Advantage BTL

Now we add the home advantage covariate (`at.home`) to the model, using the `formula` statement.



```r
fit &lt;- BTm(outcome, Home, Away, 
           data = data,
           id = "Team", 
           formula = ~ Team + at.home
           )
```

---

# Problem

1. What does the `at.home` effect suggest about the home advantage in the 2017-2018 EPL?

2. How do the abilities change compared to our previous fit without this advantage?

---

# Solution: Home Advantage Estimate


```r
summary(fit)$coef["at.home",]
```

```
##    Estimate  Std. Error     z value    Pr(&gt;|z|) 
## -0.22472102  0.11565309 -1.94306103  0.05200879
```

---

# Solution: Change In Abilities

![](paired-comparison_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Reverse Home Advantage?

- Our results suggest that playing at home is actually a _disadvantage_.

- This goes against all conventional thinking!

- Could we have made a mistake somewhere?

--

It's because we haven't handled ties/draws properly and there are a lot of them.


```r
mean(data$FTHG == data$FTAG) # Frequency of draws
```

```
## [1] 0.2605263
```

---

# Problem: Effect of Ties

- Fit a BTM + Home advantage excluding matches with ties

- Determine the estimate of the home advantage

- What do you conclude about the importance of handling ties for our model?

---

# Solution: Effect of Ties


```r
data$Home &lt;- data$Away &lt;- NULL

data &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(FTHG != FTAG) # Remove ties

data$Home &lt;- data.frame(
  Team = data$HomeTeam, 
  at.home = 1
)

data$Away &lt;- data.frame(
  Team = data$AwayTeam, 
  at.home = 0
)

fit &lt;- BTm(outcome, Home, Away, 
           data = data,
           id = "Team", 
           formula = ~ Team + at.home
           )

summary(fit)$coef["at.home",]
```

```
##     Estimate   Std. Error      z value     Pr(&gt;|z|) 
## 7.113750e-01 1.595918e-01 4.457466e+00 8.293409e-06
```

# Dynamic Paired Comparisons

- Our example paired comparison model assumed that the ability of teams was constant

- It might be more reasonable to allow the ability of teams/players to update with new results

- In other words, we want a way to estimate team/player ability _dynamically_


---

# Elo System

The 'Elo' system is the most popular dynamic paired comparison model. It was developed for chess in the 1950s but is now used for rating competitors in many sports. 

![](538.png)

---

# Elo Example: Major League Baseball




```
## Warning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values (geom_path).
```

![](paired-comparison_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Elo System

The standard Elo system predicts game/match results based on the rating difference of the competitors:

$$
P_{ij} = 1 / (1 + 10^{(R_j - R_i)/400})
$$
 - This is a logistic prediction (using base 10 instead of e)
 
 - The 400 is an artifact of Elo's original system and is usually 2 SD of the rating difference distribution
 
---
 
# Update Rules


After each result, ratings `\(R_i\)` and `\(R_j\)` are updated according to the following rule:

$$
R_{new} = R_{old} + K * (Result - P_{ij})
$$

- Ratings always increase with wins and decrease with losses

- `\(K\)` is the learning rate that determines how sensitive the system is to each new result

- `\(K\)` can be a constant or a function of some other variables

- `\(R_0\)` is usually set to 1500

---

# Elo in R

Suppose we knew that `\(K=20\)` was a good choice. We can write a function to perform Elo updates in R like follows:



```r
elo &lt;- function(winners, losers) {
		
		win_prob &lt;- function(elo_a, elo_b) {
		  return(1 / (1 + 10^((elo_b - elo_a) / 400)))
		}
		
		lookup &lt;- function(name, list, default){
			if(name %in% names(list)){
				list[[name]]
			}
			else{
				default
			}
		}

		 ratings &lt;- list()
	   		
	   results &lt;- data.frame(
	   						winner_elo = numeric(length(winners)), 
	             loser_elo = numeric(length(winners))
	   						)
	
	   for (i in seq_along(winners)) {
	
	   cur_winner &lt;- winners[i]
	    cur_loser &lt;- losers[i]
	
	    winner_elo &lt;- lookup(cur_winner, ratings, 1500)
	    loser_elo &lt;- lookup(cur_loser, ratings, 1500)
	
		  winner_prob &lt;- win_prob(winner_elo, loser_elo)
		
	    winner_update &lt;- 20 * (1 - winner_prob)
	    loser_update &lt;- 20 * (0 - (1 - winner_prob)) 
	    
	    ratings[[cur_winner]] = winner_elo + winner_update 
	    ratings[[cur_loser]] = loser_elo + loser_update 

	    results$winner_elo[i] &lt;- ratings[[cur_winner]]
	    results$loser_elo[i] &lt;- ratings[[cur_loser]]
	  }

return(results)
}
```

---

# Example: 2018 MLB

Let's see what the Elo ratings for the MLB would show if we looked only from 2017 on.


```r
mlb_elo &lt;- mlb_elo %&gt;% filter(season &gt;= 2017) %&gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(date = ymd(date)) %&gt;%
  arrange(date)

elo_2018 &lt;- elo(mlb_elo$team1, mlb_elo$team2)

tail(cbind(mlb_elo[,c("team1", "team2")], elo_2018))
```

```
##      team1 team2 winner_elo loser_elo
## 4893   CIN   PIT   1482.684  1458.429
## 4894   ANA   OAK   1518.611  1490.174
## 4895   SFG   LAD   1527.055  1458.649
## 4896   PHI   ATL   1508.852  1514.254
## 4897   BOS   NYY   1549.884  1485.615
## 4898   BAL   HOU   1523.464  1478.741
```
